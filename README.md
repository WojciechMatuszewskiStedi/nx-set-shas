# About this repo

I forked the original repo so that it is possible to use this action in the context of [Github Merge Queues](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue).

See [this issue](https://github.com/nrwl/nx-set-shas/issues/90#issuecomment-1569690668) for more context.
